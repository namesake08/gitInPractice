Hidden at the back of the cupboard
Is a concealed tin
Rusted, faded biscuit label
Masks its true contents
Most in the household have forgotten it
Prefer to go for the bright and new
If only they would take the time
To prise open its jammed lid
It won't be easy
So only for the strong
But not for those spruiking false mochismo
Ultimately they will run away shrieking in terror
